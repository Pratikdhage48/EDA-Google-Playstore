4. Data Source

Source: Kaggle - Google Play Store Apps Dataset

Data Structure:

Contains information about ~10,000 Android apps, including:

App Name, Category

Rating, Number of Reviews

Installs, Type (Free/Paid), Price

Size, Content Rating

Genres, Last Updated, etc.


5. Business Problem

With over 3 million apps on the Play Store, identifying trends, high-performing categories, and user preferences is crucial for app developers and business strategists. Raw data alone doesn’t help in making decisions unless visualized and analyzed properly.

6. Goal of the Project

To perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of Google Play Store data to:

Identify top-performing categories

Analyze factors affecting app ratings and installs

Compare free vs paid apps in terms of popularity and price

Detect outliers or inconsistencies in app data
